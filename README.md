# Best Checkpoints (total time)

Fork of [Best Checkpoints](https://openplanet.dev/plugin/bestcheckpoints) plugin.

It has been altered to operate on checkpoint total times (from the start of the run) instead of sector times like the original plugin. Usually this information is more useful and easier to interpret when hunting and judging your pace and potential on a map.

Primary use:
- Stores between sessions your fastest splits to reach each checkpoint and splits of your PB run
- Shows run overview table with deltas to your bests
